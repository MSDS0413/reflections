When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
	So that I could have an remote copy even if my local original ones were corrupted or something else.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because sometimes, we need to keep the original version as online version will not be good enough.
