When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	So that I could have an remote copy even if my local original ones were corrupted or something else.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because sometimes, we need to keep the original version as online version will not be good enough.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	Forks create copies on GitHub, clones create copies on local storage, and branches keep different features.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	You could check the difference between original version, GitHub Version and the one you are working on and decide which features could be retained.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Of course, you don't need to learn Git or GitHub and those relatively hard concepts. However, Git and GitHub provide excellent paradigm to do version control.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	When one new feature is experimentally implemented. The benifit of it is that it will not affect the mainstream original work.
