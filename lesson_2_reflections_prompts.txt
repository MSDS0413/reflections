What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Start a new repository. With a repository, we could add files to staging area so that we could track the changes with commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area keeps track on those files we want to track differences while working directory stores those files and repository also keeps log of those changes.
